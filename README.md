# DoubleLayeredNN
A double layered Neural Network trained using back propagation.

The input data file should have the following format:
1. each attribute should have a label and a value seperated by :
2. attributes should be seperated by space
3. each data point should have its own row
4. true label of the data should be the first value in the data point

Put the data file in the DATA_PATH variable.
This Neural Network uses sigmoid function as activation function.
